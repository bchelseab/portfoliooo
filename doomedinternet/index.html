				<div id="elegacy" class="essay">There was once a time before the internet. We know this because of the existence of a thorough historical record, one that goes back eons- carved in stone, scrawled on papyrus, printed on books, and spoken into waiting ears. Humanity has, in fact, spent a majority of its time on Earth surviving before the internet was created. But no matter how hard my peers and I may try to empathize with history, that kind of living will never be something we can fully comprehend.
	<br><br>For the youngest generations today, the internet is so all-encompassing that our current lives would be impossible without it. We cannot imagine a world without this connection and access. Everything we do and care about and value- instant messages with a friend, photos of a family member, artwork and films and novels and every single bit of scientific research, every dollar in our bank accounts, the answers to every question on our minds- lives online. And only online. If there is to be any record left behind of who we were as a people, it relies on the continued existence of the internet. As it is, so many of us have come to depend on the internet, but so few really understand it. Most internet users would struggle to put into words just where it came from and how it functions. We take for granted its continued functioning, expecting this to be as eternal and regular as the rising of the sun. Even worse, we are ignorant of the threats that bring its destruction closer every day. There is a very real possibility that in time, every aspect of our culture that resides in the digital realm will be gone. Our memories and accomplishments could disappear without a trace. We may one day be forced to answer a rather uncomfortable question: has our blind faith in technology doomed us to be a blank space in history?
