					<p>Opening in a massive space at the North Shore Mall, the folks at Webber Restaurant Group wanted to welcome the people of Peabody to their new restaurant by speaking to the town's blue collar roots. With a focus on craft beer and quality pub fare, they've filled the two-story restaurant with eclectic memoriabillia and an impressive selection of arcade games.</p>
					<p>In order to craft a brand that matched Webber's vision for The Double Bull, I referenced a lot of vintage industrial signage and handpainted lettering. Collaborating with my team, we designed a logo and brand with an old-school aesthetic that's bold and playful. I further developed the brand into the restaurant's menu, website, and other collateral. The logo mark I designed also lives on in five feet of neon at the heart of the restaurant.</p>

		<div class="project-info"><h3>The process</h3>
			<p>I explored numerous type options that felt as retro and ecclectic as the restaurant's decor. I also tested out a number of illustration styles for the bull heads.</p>

			<p>We landed on a complete set of logos that could fit every occasion, from painted signage, to beer glasses, to coasters, and more.</p>

		<div class="project-info"><h3>The Menu</h3>
		<p>With an impressive list of both bar snacks and quality wines, the menu content lends itself to a bit of an organized-chaos approach.</p>

		<div class="project-info"><h3>Website</h3>
		<p>The Double Bull is more than just a place to eat, so I designed the website to highlight the various league nights, games, and other events that draw a wider audience to the restaurant.</p>
